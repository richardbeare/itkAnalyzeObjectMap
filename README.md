## Read Mayo Clinic Object Map files

Convert and manipluate Analyze object map files.

Manual edits in Analyze create run length encoded images. This code,
originally published in the [Insight Journal](http://hdl.handle.net/1926/593),
reads these files and allows manipulation of the objects, including
creating labels and colours. There is also code for creating object maps.

This repo contains some updates to CMake structure and removes a couple
of warnings.
